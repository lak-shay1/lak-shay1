Lakshay Arora
Software Engineer | Computer Science Graduate

I am a Computer Science graduate from RMIT University (2025) with a focus on building high-performance, scalable cloud systems and intelligent data solutions. My work bridges the gap between software engineering, DevOps, and AI.

Technical Focus
Scalable Infrastructure: Experience managing containerized environments using Kubernetes, Docker, and GitOps workflows.
Intelligent Systems: Developing data pipelines and applying NLP (BERTopic, VADER) to extract insights from massive datasets.
System Performance: Writing memory-efficient code in C++, Rust, and Java to optimize system throughput.
Security & Reliability: Maintaining high code quality through rigorous automated testing and CI/CD orchestration.

Tech Stack

Languages: Python, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, C++, Rust, Swift.
Cloud & DevOps: AWS (Lambda, S3, DynamoDB), Kubernetes, Docker, GitHub Actions, FluxCD.
Web: React.js, Node.js, REST APIs.
ML/AI: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, LLM Prompt Engineering.

Current Objectives
Agentic AI: Exploring how autonomous agents can improve developer productivity and system resilience.
Distributed Systems: Deepening my expertise in microservices architecture and cloud-native observability.

Recent Projects
Cross-Platform NLP Analytics: Scraped and analyzed ~125k data points to identify cross-platform sentiment trends.
Event Management Platform: A full-stack Spring Boot and React application containerized for Kubernetes deployment.
AWS Music Streaming: A serverless architecture leveraging Lambda and DynamoDB for high availability.
